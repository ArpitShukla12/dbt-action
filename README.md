# Atlan dbt Action

![atlan<>dbt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14099191/209542321-54d5557e-8abf-4d9a-9f6d-dcacb856f25f.png)

## Overview

*Have you changed a dbt model and realised that it broke a table or a dashboard downstream ðŸ’”?*

To solve that, weâ€™ve created a GitHub action that will add Atlan's lineage context right in your pull request. So before
merging the PR, you know the downstream impact of the change. Here's how it'll look like ðŸ‘‡

2. Add the GitHub Action to your workflow
    1. Create a file in the root directory of your repository, `.github/workflows/atlan-action.yml`
    2. Add the following code to your workflow file.

        ```yaml
        name: Atlan dbt action
        
        on:
          pull_request:
            types: [opened, edited, synchronize, reopened, closed]
        
        jobs:
          get-downstream-impact:
            name: Get Downstream Assets
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Run Action
                uses: atlanhq/dbt-action@v1-beta
                with:
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
                  ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL: ${{secrets.ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL}}
                  ATLAN_API_TOKEN: ${{secrets.ATLAN_API_TOKEN}}
        
        ```

## How to test

After you've completed both steps in setup, try creating a PR where you've changed any model file. You'll see Atlan
Github action running in action and adding comments in your pull request.
